            <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p><small>Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field which combines statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and database technology.  
        Many businesses have stored large amounts of data over years of operation, and data science is able to extract very valuable knowledge from this data.  The businesses are then able to leverage the extracted knowledge into more clients, more sales, and greater profits. 
        This is also true in the engineering and medical fields. </small></p>

            <p><small> Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. 
        Python has become one of the most popular programming languages for machine learning due to its simplicity, flexibility, and powerful libraries. 
We will explore scikit-learn, one of the most popular Python libraries for machine learning.<br><br>

Scikit-learn, also known as sklearn, is an open-source, machine learning and data modeling library for Python. 
It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, 
random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python libraries, 
NumPy and SciPy.</small></p>

    <p><small> There are some basic approaches: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 
        The main difference is that one uses labeled data to help predict outcomes, while the other does not. 
        The raw material is the historical data which is analyzed and modeled to generate a predictive algorithm. 
        The historical data available and the business problem to be solved allow us to classify the machine learning algorithms 
        in broadly four classes: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.   </small></p>

            <h1>Supervised Learning Algorithms</h1>
    <p><small>Supervised learning is statistical models where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) 
        and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. 
        The output is the value that we wish to predict and is referred to as the target variable and the data used to make that prediction is called training data. 
        The target variable is sometimes referred to as the label.</small></p>
        <img src="images\ch1-2.jpg" alt="ch1-2" width="500">
    <p><small>
        Supervised learning problems are used in demand prediction, credit card fraud detection, customer churn prediction, premium estimation, etc. 
        Supervised learning algorithms can be further broken into regression algorithms and classification algorithms.

            <h1>Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</h1>
    <p><small>Unsupervised learning is the set of approaches that focus on finding `hidden patterns` and insights from the given dataset. 
        In such cases, we do not require labelled data. The goal of such approaches is to find the underlying structure of the data, 
        simplify or compress the dataset, or group the data according to inherent similarities.<br>

  Imagine you are given some paper labels.  The task is to arrange them using some similarities. 
  Now there are multiple approaches to that problem. You can use color, shape, or size. 
  Here we do not have any label with us to guide on this arrangement. This is the difference which unsupervised algorithm have.<br>

  Unsupervised learning is hence used for pattern detection, exploring the insights in the dataset and understanding the structure of it, 
  segmentation, and anomaly detection</small></p>

            <h1>Clustering Algorithms</h1>
    <p><small>One common task in unsupervised learning is clustering, which is a method of grouping data points (or objects) into clusters 
        so that the objects that are similar to each other are assigned to one group 
        while making sure that they are significantly different from the items present in other groups. 
        It is highly useful in identifying potential customer segments for directing the marketing efforts and partitioning an image for segmenting into different objects.

            <h1>Supervised Learning I : Classification</h1>
    <h2>K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h2>
    <p><small>
      "Birds of a feather flock together". Data science uses this principle to classify data 
      by placing it in the same category as <strong>similar</strong> or <strong>k nearest</strong> neighbors. 
      <strong>K nearest neighbors</strong> is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). 
      It is a lazy learning.<br>
  The letter $k$ is a variable term implying that any number of nearest neighbors could be used. 
  In particular, the "nearest" in similarity. The k-NN algorithm treats the features as coordinates in a multidimensional feature space.

    <p><small>Regression is a a supervised learning technique that models the size and the strength of numeric relationships. 
        Regression is concerned with specifying the relationship between a single numeric dependent variable (the value to be predicted) 
        and one or more numeric independent variables (the predictors).</small></p>

            <h1>What Is Linear Regression</h1>
    <img src="images\2025070901.jpg" alt="2025070901" width="500">
    <p><small>Be careful with <strong>infinite loops</strong> — always ensure the condition will eventually become `False`.
    The objective of the linear regression analysis is to measure this relationship and arrive at a mathematical equation for the relationship. 
    The relationship can be used to predict the values for unseen data points. 
    For example, in the case of the house price problem, predicting the price of a 
    house will be the objective of the analysis</small></p>

    <p><small>It is represented by random error, 
        which is the difference between the predicted and actual value of Y and is given by $\varepsilon=(\hat{Y}_i -Y_i)$. 
        It is important to note that the smaller the value of this error, the better is the prediction. 
        There can be multiple lines which can be said to represent the relationship.</small></p>
    <img src="images\2025070903.jpg" alt="2025070903" width="400">
    <p><small>Hence, it turns out that we have to find out the best mathematical equation 
        which can minimize the random error and hence can be used for making the predictions.<br>
    The Ordinary least-squares (OLS) method is one of the most used and quoted ones which minimize the sum of the squared distance between $Y$ and $\hat{Y}$

            <h1>Unsupervised Learning: Clustering</h1>

        We are going to study basic clustering algorithms which are K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN clustering.</small></p>

            <h1>K-means clustering</h1>
    <p><small>k-means clustering is an easy and straightforward approach. 
        It is arguably the most widely used clustering method to segment the data points and create nonoverlapping clusters. 
        We have to specify the number of clusters “k” we wish to create as an input and 
        the algorithm will associate each observation to exactly one of the k clusters.<br>

  The objective of k-means clustering is to ensure that the within-cluster variation is as small as possible 
  while the difference between clusters is as big as possible. 
  In other words, the members of the same cluster are most similar to each other while members in different clusters are dissimilar.</small></p>
    <h2>Finding the optimum value of “k”</h2>
    <p><small>One of the most popular methods to do so is the <strong>Elbow Method</strong> 
        which calculate different scenarios for different numbers of clusters and then plot them in a line</small></p>
