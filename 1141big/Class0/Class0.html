    <h1>Data Science</h1>
    <p><small>
        Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field which combines statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and database technology.  
        Many businesses have stored large amounts of data over years of operation, and data science is able to extract very valuable knowledge from this data.  
        The businesses are then able to leverage the extracted knowledge into more clients, more sales, and greater profits. 
        This is also true in the engineering and medical fields.

    Statistics and mathematics are of paramount importance for complete and concrete knowledge of ML. 
    The mathematical and statistical algorithms used in making the predictions are based on concepts like linear algebra, 
    matrix multiplications, concepts of geometry, vector-space diagrams, and so on.

    <p><small> 
       The raw material is the historical data which is analyzed and modeled to generate a predictive algorithm. 
       The historical data available and the business problem to be solved allow us 
       to classify the machine learning algorithms in broadly four classes: 
       supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

    <h2>Supervised Learning Algorithms</h2>
    <p><small>
    Supervised models are statistical models which use both the input data and the desired output to predict the future. 
    The output is the value that we wish to predict and is referred to as the target variable and the data used to make that prediction is called training data. 
    The target variable is sometimes referred to as the label.
    </small></p>
    <img src="images\ch1-2.jpg" alt="ch1-2" width="300">
    <p><small>
        Supervised learning problems are used in demand prediction, credit card fraud detection, customer churn prediction, premium estimation, etc. 
        Supervised learning algorithms can be further broken into regression algorithms and classification algorithms

    <h2>Regression algorithms</h2>
    <img src="images\2025072307.jpg" alt="2025072307" width="300">
    <p><small>
        Regression algorithms are are used to predict the values of a continuous variable. 
        A regression model will be able to find the inherent patterns in the data and fit a mathematical equation describing the relationship
    </small></p>  
    <img src="images\2025072308.jpg" alt="2025072308" width="300"> 
    <p><small>
        The objective of the linear regression problem is to find the line of best fit which is able to explain the randomness present in the data

        For example, You want to go straight to the target and find out how much a customer might spend based on their historic data. 
        You are now looking at a numerical scale measurement for an answer. 
        It can range anywhere from £5 to £15 per visit. Imagine every time you see a new customer walk into your bakery you see the amount they are most likely to spend floating above their head. This is a `regression` situation
    </small></p>
    <p><small>
        The next regression algorithm we are discussing is Tree based solutions. For tree-based algorithms like decision trees, random forests etc. 
        The algorithm will start from the top and then like an “if-else” block will split iteratively to create nodes and sub-nodes till we reach a terminal node

    <h1>Classification Algorithms</h1>
    <p><small>
       Classification algorithms are used to predict the values of a categorical variable which is the dependent variable. 
       This target variable can be binary (Yes/No, good/bad, fraud/genuine, pass/fail, etc.) or multi-class (positive/negative/neutral, Yes/No/Don’t know, etc.).

        For example, Imagine you own a bakery. But you want to know if the people truly like your bakery or not.  
        The answer you are looking forward is a simple Yes or No. `Do people like your bakery or not? `<br>
        This type of machine learning is known as `classification`. 
        Sometimes there are more than 2 categories. For example how much do people like your bakery (Very much, Quite a bit, Not at all). 
        These are ordinal classifiers. Ordinal classifiers can also be 1, 2 or 3 but remember this is not the same as regression

    <h1>Unsupervised Learning Algorithms</h1>
    <p><small>
        Unsupervised learning is the set of approaches that focus on finding hidden patterns and insights from the given dataset. 
        In such cases, we do not require labelled data. The goal of such approaches is 
        to find the underlying structure of the data, simplify or compress the dataset, or group the data according to inherent similarities.<br>
        Imagine you are given some paper labels.  The task is to arrange them using some similarities. 
        Now there are multiple approaches to that problem. You can use color, shape, or size. 
        Here we do not have any label with us to guide on this arrangement. This is the difference which unsupervised algorithm have.<br>
        Unsupervised learning is hence used for pattern detection, exploring the insights in the dataset 
        and understanding the structure of it, segmentation, and anomaly detection.

    <h1>Clustering Algorithms</h1>
    <p><small>
        One common task in unsupervised learning is clustering, which is a method of grouping data points (or objects) into clusters 
        so that the objects that are similar to each other are assigned to one group 
        while making sure that they are significantly different from the items present in other groups. 
        It is highly useful in identifying potential customer segments for directing the marketing efforts and partitioning an image for segmenting into different objects

        you just want to know if there are groups of customers who are likely to act in a particular way. 
        Do little kids always go for the cupcakes with cartoon characters. 
        Do young teens with their girlfriend / boyfriend go for heart shaped one? 
        You want the data to frame the question and answer it. 
        We are looking for `patterns, groups or clusters` in the data. This is the `Clustering` problem.

    <h1>Semi-supervised learning and Reinforcement learning</h1>
    <p><small>
       Semi-supervised learning is a middle-path of the two approaches. 
       The primary reason for a semi-supervised approach is lack of availability of a complete labeled dataset for training.
       In semi-supervised learning, we train initially on less number of labeled data points available using a supervised algorithm. 
       And then we use it to label or pseudo-label new data points. 
       The two datasets (labeled and pseudo-labeled) are combined together and we use this dataset further for analysis.
    </small></p>
    <p><small>
       Reinforcement learning solutions are self-sustained solutions which train themselves using a sequence of trial and error. 
       The heart of reinforcement learning is reward signals. 
       If the action is positive then the reward is positive indicating to continue on it. 
       If the action is negative, the reward will penalize the activity. 
       Hence, the solution will always correct itself and move ahead thereby improving itself iteratively.
