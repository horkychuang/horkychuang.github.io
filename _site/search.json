    "text": "Supervised Learning: Classification\n\nImagine you own a bakery. But you want to know if the people truly like your bakery or not.\nThe answer you are looking forward is a simple Yes or No. Do people like your bakery or not?\nThis type of machine learning is known as classification. Sometimes there are more than 2 categories. For example how much do people like your bakery (Very much, Quite a bit, Not at all).\nThese are ordinal classifiers. Ordinal classifiers can also be 1, 2 or 3 but remember this is not the same as regression."

You want to go straight to the target and find out how much a customer might spend based on their historic data.\nYou are now looking at a numerical scale measurement for an answer. It can range anywhere from £5 to £15 per visit. Imagine every time you see a new customer walk into your bakery you see the amount they are most likely to spend floating above their head.\nThis is a regression situation."
