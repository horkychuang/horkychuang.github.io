    <h2>What is Social Network</h2>
    <p><small>
A social network is a structure composed of a set of actors, some of which are connected by a set of one or more relations. SNA work at describing underlying patterns of social structure, explaining the impact of such patterns in behavior and attitudes. 
社會網路是由⼀組 ⾏動者組成的結構，其中⼀些 ⾏動者通過⼀組或多組關係連接在⼀起。SNA 致⼒於描述社會結構的基本模式，解釋這種模式對⾏為和態度的影響。<br>
SNA看關係-- 雙元關係, 三元關係, ⼩集團關係, 特定節點關係, 整個網絡

    <h2>Build a Network</h2>
    <p><small>
        The rapid construction of a network implies the ability to quickly identify and foster relationships 
        that can contribute to the growth and effectiveness of social connectivity. <br>
        Building a robust network often involves engaging with key influencers, participating in relevant conversations, 
        and providing value to others.

    <h2>Network Visualization</h2>
    <p> <small> 
    Visualizing networks is a method to graphically represent the various elements of a network 
    and the connections between them. It helps to succinctly convey the complexities of social interactions 
    and can be invaluable for recognizing patterns, 
    identifying clusters or communities, and facilitating the understanding of large-scale structures.

    <h2>Vertex Characteristics</h2>
    <p><small>
    The vertices or nodes of a network represent individual actors within the network, 
    and they can have numerous characteristics. 
    Their attributes could include the number of connections they have (degree), 
    their ability to bring disparate nodes together (betweenness), 
    and their overall influence within the network (centrality).

<div class="discussion">
    <h2>Actor Prominence: power, influence, visibility, or prestige</h2>
    <p> <small> 
    Actor prominence within a social network can be determined through various centrality measures such as degree centrality, 
    closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and Eigenvector centrality. 
    Each of these measures gives a different perspective on an actor's position and influence within the network.<br>
    An actor’s power, influence, visibility, or prestige can shape the flow and spread of information within a network. 
    These metrics are not only essential for theoretical study 
    but also have practical implications in fields like marketing and urban planning.

    <h2>Network Relation</h2>
    <p><small> 
    In social network analysis, the term 'network relation' refers to the type of connection between nodes within the network. 
    The nature of these relations can be diverse, ranging from friendships, kinship, 
    and professional ties to communication channels or data exchange routes.<br>
    Understanding the relationships within a network can provide crucial insights into its structure and functionality, 
    impacting the diffusion of information and the spread of social phenomena.

    <h2>Dyads 雙元關係: Density and Reciprocity</h2>
    <p><small>
     Dyads are the simplest possible social networks consisting of just two nodes and their mutual relationship. 
     The study of dyads involves assessing aspects 
     such as density and reciprocity, which can lead to understanding the bilateral dynamics in a network.

    <h2>Network Segmentation</h2>
    <p><small>
    Segmenting a network involves identifying and categorizing distinct groups or communities within the network. 
    This process can help understand how groups are formed, 
    how they interact with one another, and can reveal the underlying structure of the network.

    <h2>Afﬁliation Networks</h2>
    <p><small>
    Affiliation networks are a specific form of social network 
    where the connections between actors are not based on direct interactions 
    but rather on shared attributes or affiliations. The primary actors, or nodes, might consist of individuals, 
    but they are linked together through common membership in groups, events, or organizations.

    The NetworkX library is well-suited for social network analysis (SNA), 
    particularly for exploratory analysis, prototyping, and educational purposes. 
    It provides a flexible and intuitive Python interface for creating, 
    manipulating, and studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks—including social networks.
